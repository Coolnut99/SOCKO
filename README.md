SOCKO! The Video Game -- a project I made for Android phones in 2017.
Email me at fdelles (at) twcny DOT rr DOT com for full version upon request.

To add to Android Phone (WARNING: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PHONE!)

Allow unknown apps to be loaded.
For 8.0+ “Settings -> Apps & notifications -> Advanced -> Special app access -> Install unknown apps.”

For 7.0 and earlier: “Settings -> Security,” and check the box marked “Unknown Sources,” then tap “OK’ and “Trust.”

Download the APK and add it to a directory.
Give it permission and allow it to install.
Open as normal.
